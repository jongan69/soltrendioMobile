# Welcome to SolTrendio Mobile ðŸ‘‹

This is a SolTrendio Mobile project built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), leveraging the power of [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the App**

   Launch the development server with:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You'll have options to open the app in:

   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox for app development with Expo

3. **Develop Your App**

   Begin development by editing files in the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset the Project

To start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a new, blank **app** directory for development.
